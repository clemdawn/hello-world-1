# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Bruno, I'm currently a 16 years old Highschool student from Chile who likes Mathematics, Science, Electronics and Computers.

I've been learning programming since 2015, but just recently I started really focusing on really improving my skills. I know a bit of Python, C#, and Javascript, but the language I'm most comfortable with is C++.

Currently learning how to make GUIs in C++ using the wxWidgets framework.

My goal for the future is study Electronic Engineering in Europe, and then specialize in something mechatronics related.
